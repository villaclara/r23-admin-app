# Road23.AdminApp
Road23AdminApp is the Web app I've designed for my wife to manage her small candle shop. She needed the warehouse-like system with possibilities to add/edit candles, add/edit orders, keeping track of expenses and some todos/notes.
It has front page with some latest Todos displayed to bring attention to the main points.

### Framework
- Blazor WASM with PWA support
- Mobile first UI with Bootstrap + CSS, however can be used in desktops as well
- Using calls to [Road23.WebApi](https://github.com/villaclara/r23-webapi) (my another project) which handles database and all that stuff.

#### Here are some screenshots:
